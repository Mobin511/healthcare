   # Health Care

   Remind yourself to take breaks. Health Care!
   ([Video demo]())

   ## Description

   I am use my computer all the time. This has had a really bad impact on
   my eyes and my back. I often used to forgot to drink water or take a
   break. That also meant I used to keep sitting for a long time.

   That is why I created this Chrome Extension. With the help of this extension, I am reminded to take a break, stand, and look away from the screen every 20 minutes. I choose 20 minutes because that is what Healthline suggests in their "[How Does the 20-20-20 Rule Prevent Eye Strain?](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule#:~:text=What's%20the%2020%2D20%2D20,a%20total%20of%2020%20seconds.)" article.

   This Chrome Extension can help you not only prevent eye strain but
   also help stay hydrated and stand for a bit every 20 minutes. You
   can, of course, easily tweak the interval as you please with basic
   customization.

   **Note:** This extension was originally submitted as my final project for [Harvard's CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x).
